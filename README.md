TextMate plugin for Varnish
===========================

While working on my presentation for the [Varnish <3 release party](varnish-release-party-milano.eventbrite.com/) I finally got tired of staring at a file in TextMate with no syntax highlighing, no symbol reference and no folding. Thus this plugin was born.

This is still very much a work in progress; I'm sure there are plenty of bugs. Pull requests are very welcome!

First pushed during the [Milano Ruby Day 2011](rubyday.it/).
